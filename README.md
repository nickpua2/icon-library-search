# Icon Library Search

This repository is for a web application that allows users to search and download icons in multiple sizes (60x60px, 90x90px, 120x120px) and their original .ai working files.

## Purpose

- Store icons in organized folders, each with three PNG sizes and the original Adobe Illustrator (.ai) file.
- Provide a frontend and backend for searching and downloading icons.
- Support drag-and-drop search by uploading an image.
